Current ==========
- AzCopy
-- Pushes backups to Azure Storage weekly based on root crontab
- SystemD
-- Allows service to be stopped and started using 'sudo system ctrlautobk start/stop'
-- Requires symbolic link from /usr/bin/ctrlautobk-py to python3.8 executable
- MySQL Backup
-- Does NOT provide replication, only pushes a dump of MySQL DB to AzBackups folder weekly at 5am before push to Azure.
Coming Soon ==========
- SSL
-- This will either be done via LetsEncrypt if we get video side DNS set up, or via local CA if we have to keep the IP only
- Maintenance Script
-- Not sure what all this will entail, but plan on running it before other periodic server maintenances, primarily to allow for server reboot to clear RAM
